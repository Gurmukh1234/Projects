CSS Introductrion:

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet
CSS describes how HTML elements need to be presented on the screen
CSS can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once
Includes adding visuals like color,fonts,layout(mobile,web,tablet,animation etc)

The syntax of CSS :

selectors in CSS
root-selector: Select all elements at once

*{
    background-color:red;
}

element-selector:
select single element by its name

span{
    background-color:red;
}

id -selector:
 select element with id attribute. One element can have only one id
 #red{
    background color:red;
}
<p id="red"> This is class</p>

class-selector: select element with class attribute. One element can have multiple classes
.red{
    background color:red;
}
<p class="red"> This is class</p>

Grouping Selector: Select elements in Group
element1,element2,element3{
    background color: red;
}

Nesting Selector: to select child-parent-siblings
ul li - ul space li means any li inside it
   ul li {
        background-color: red;
      }

      div>b means only b that is just inside div
      div > b {
        background-color: red;
      }


Pseudoclass-selectors: For Interaction
if element: hover written, then that element will got the property whwn user hover on it

:focus mostly work on inputs or buttons whn click only then property applied

    li:hover{
        background-color: red;
      }

      .input:focus{
        background-color: red;
      }

      Topic-Styling with CSS

      1. COLORS
      The color poperty is used to set the foreground color of an elements text
      -By name:
      140 diff colors named in CSS. Example: orange,red,green,blue,red,lightgrey etc

      -Using rgb
      Absence of all color is black
    Presence of all color is white
    Defined from 0 to 255
    16581375-Combination possible

    By Hex Code:
    Similar to rgb but different to written
    Use hexadecimal numbers- 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f= Total 16
    ff=255
    written using #
    #rrggbb

    Using RGBa:
    we have to give alpha value for thatTo check transparency from 0 to 1
    0 for transparent

     - CSS units are used to express size of different properties
      Expresed as number followed by unit symbol. Ex: 16px,180mm,2rem
      Many properties use css unit as its value such as width,height,margin,padding,border-size etc

      Two types of CSS units
      Absolute units
      The Absolute Units a fixed size/length of element
      ex- cm,mm(millimeter in inches)(1inch=96px=2.54cm),px(1px=1/96th of 1 inch),pt(points(1 pt=1/72 of 1 inch)),pc(picas, 1pc=12pt)

      Relative Units
      Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property

      em-relative to font-size of element(parent)
      rem-relative to font-size of root element
      vw=relative to 1% of the width of browser window size
       vh=relative to 1% of the height of browser window size
       %= relative to the parent element

       border

       Tesxt and Font Styling
       font-size
       font-family
       font-weight
       font-style
       color

       text-align
       text-indent
       text-transformation
       text-decoration
       line-height
       letter-spacing
       word-spacing
       text-shadow

       <!-- Remains in layout but will be hidden and doesn't occupy space-->==Display none
       display: inline-block;--Remain inline but possess properties of block level element also
       1rem =16px

       Position- Static(Default), Relative, Absolute, Fixed, Sticky
                                     |
                                     Gives 4 properties- top,right,bottom,left
                                     We give only two properies

Absolute works relative to body and can change if parent has position relative
Fixed works relative to body      
Sticky changes from fixed to relative
